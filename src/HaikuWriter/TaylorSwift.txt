I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open/shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say
 the less I know
Wherever you stray
 I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow
 I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say
 the less I know
Wherever you stray
 I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a nineties trend
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open/shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait and switch was a work of art
The more that you say
 the less I know
Wherever you stray
 I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
The more that you say
 the less I know
Wherever you stray
 I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
 that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
 that's my man
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass
 I dropped it
Champagne problems
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating
Dom Perignon
 you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech
 you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke
 Well it's made for me
How evergreen
 our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money
 two for the show
I never was ready
 so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in
I don't like a gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past
 quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying until the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush
What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties
I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We wandered around had never
Seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day old tea
because it could never be
because I don't like a gold rush
 gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past
 quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying until the bone crush
Everybody wants you
And I don't like a gold rush
What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties
I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We never found will never
See a love as pure as it
because it fades into the gray of my day old tea
because it will never be
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in
If I wanted to know
Who you were hanging with
While I was gone
 I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold
Fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you
Put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me
So we could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
'Tis the damn season
 write this down
I'm staying at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
I parked my car
Right between the Methodist and the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run but only so far
I escaped it too
Remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you
It's okay with me
We could call it even
'Tis the damn season
 write this down
I'm staying at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile
 hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
Sleep in half the day
Just for old times sake
I won't ask you to wait
If you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to LA
And the so called friends who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm faking
And the heart I know I'm breaking is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
'Tis the damn season
We could call it even
'Tis the damn season
 write this down
I'm staying at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile
 hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
 I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen
 I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
While you were out building other worlds
 where was I
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire
I made you my temple
 my mural
  my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine
But what would you do if I
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me
 I could do it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you
 when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it
 all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief
 I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
Tell me
 when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
 I didn't mean that
Sorry
 I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things
 I believe
There is happiness
In our history
 across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight
 leave it all behind
And there is happiness
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night
 now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too
 when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
In our history
 across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight
 leave it all behind
 leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me
When we were younger
Down in the park
Honey
 making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya
This place is the same as it ever was
But you won't like it that way
It's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know that you'll always know me
 you're a queen
Selling dreams
Selling make up and magazines
Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me
When it was calmer
Skipping the prom
Just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn
 Dorothea
They all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul
I met under the bleachers Well
I guess I'll never know
And you'll go on with the show
But it's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know you'll always know me
Break my soul in two
Looking for you but you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon
Did I close my fist around something delicate
Did I shatter you
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go
The fast times
 the bright lights
  the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments
 close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care
because we were like the mall before the Internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief
 the gift wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments
 close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line by the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake
 happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name
I'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go
The fast times
 the bright lights
  the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments
 close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my
Making you my
Making you my centerfold
How's one to know
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't
 I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine
 but it's been promised to another
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone
 your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine
 but it's been promised to another
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone
 your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose
 the time is near
What would he do if he found us out
Crescent moon
 coast is clear
Spring breaks loose
 but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine
 but it's been promised to another
 I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone
 your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
 it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah
 it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it
 I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone
 your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said
 Dancing is a dangerous game
 I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it
You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
And I'm never gonna love again
I tried to pick my battles
'Til the battle picked me
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits
 walk in it
'Til your high heels break
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short
 it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short
 it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us
This time I'm ready
because I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short
 it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short
 it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you
No more keeping score
Now I just keep you warm
Keep you warm
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more
Know there's more
No more keeping score
Now I just keep you warm
Keep you warm
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses will defeat themselves
Before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits
 walk in it
Everywhere you go
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short
 it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short
 I survived
Now I'm all about you
And now I'm all about you
And now I'm all about you
And now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
Long story short
 it was a bad time
Long story short
 I survived
Never be so kind
 you forget to be clever
Never be so clever
 you forget to be kind
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
 you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
 so alive
Never be so polite
 you forget your power
Never wield such power
 you forget to be polite
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
 you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
because every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
 you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
 so alive
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now
 I got your letter
 I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
 I got your letter
 I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your closure
Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears
And my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over
 I got your letter
 I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
 I got your letter
 I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I know I'm just a
Wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends
Would iron it out so nice
 guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake
And it's oh so unnecessary
 I got your letter
 I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double crossed
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
 can we just get a pause
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves
 out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross
And when I was shipwrecked
Can't think of all the cost
I thought of you
All the things that will be lost now
In the cracks of light
Can we just get a pause
I dreamed of you
To be certain we'll be tall again
If you think of all the costs
It was real enough
Whether weather be the frost
To get me through
Or the violence of the dog days
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves
 out being tossed
I swear
Is there a line that we could just go cross
You were there
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Friends break up
 friends get married
Strangers get born
 strangers get buried
Trends change
 rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I'm right where you left me
 I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross legged in the dim light
They say
 What a sad sight
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on
  I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective
 but I sat and stared
Right where you left me
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen
Time went on for everybody else
 she won't know it
She's still twenty three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion
Breakups happen every day
 you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross legged in the dim light
Everything was just right
I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on
 I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross legged in the dim light
I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas
 but I'm unaware
because I'm right where
I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong
I'm right where
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed
 not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Fifteen years
 fifteen million tears
Begging until my knees bled
I gave it my all
 he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When it's time to go
There's something about the way The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
 you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
We're driving down the road
 I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
 run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
  drive slow until we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here
in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now
 capture it
  remember it
because I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance In a storm in my best dress
 you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
 I'm not usually this way but You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss
 it's flawless
  really something
It's fearless because I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around before
because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
 feeling like there's nothing to figure out
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough
you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your mama's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing around your room when the night ends
When the night ends
because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then
 I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
 don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
Your very first day
Take a deep breath
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights
 see the party
  the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo
 you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
 Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you
 Please don't go
  and I said
 take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
 all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet because we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
because you were Romeo
 I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
 Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you
 Please don't go
  and I said
 take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
 all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
  just say
 save me
  they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
 but it's real
Don't be afraid
 we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story
And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
   I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you
 but you never come
Is this in my head I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
 and said
Marry me
  you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
 go pick out a white dress
It's a love story
Hey Stephen
 I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen
  you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
because I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
 I can't help myself
Hey Stephen
 I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all
 so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk
 way you talk
  way you say my name
It's beautiful
 wonderful
  don't you ever change
Hey Stephen
 why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same
because I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
 I can't help myself
They're dimming the street lights
 you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now
 so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine
 I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
  they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
 I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
 I can't help myself
 I can't help myself
Say you're sorry
 that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
because I honestly believed in you
Holding on
 the days drag on
Stupid girl
 I should of known
  I should of known
That I'm not a princess
 this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
 lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood
 this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive
 got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake
 I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings
 now I know
That I'm not a princess
 this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
 lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood
 this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness
 begging for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry
because I'm not your princess
 this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world
 that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
You're on the phone with your girlfriend
 she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
because she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
 it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
because she wears short skirts
 I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
 so why can't you see
You belong with me
 you belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench
 thinking to myself
 isn't this easy
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine
 I know you better than that
 whatcha doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels
 I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
 so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
You belong with me
 you belong with me
 I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
 so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
because none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
because it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple
 never easy
Never a clean break
 no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe without you
 but I have to
Breathe without you
 but I have to
Never wanted this
 never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road
 I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout
And we know it's never simple
 never easy
Never a clean break
 no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe without you
 but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
 feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy
 easy for me
 feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy
 easy for me
And we know it's never simple
 never easy
Never a clean break
 no one here to save me
I can't breathe without you
 but I have to
Breathe without you
 but I have to
I took a chance
 I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof
 but I'm not
You took a swing
 I took it hard
And down here from the ground
 I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me
 then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
 I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfect day
 I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me
 then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
 I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me
 then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love
 then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
 I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
I take a step back
 I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
  but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
 but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you
  like I did before
You're not sorry
You're looking so innocent
 I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
because it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you
  like I did before
You're not sorry
You had me crawling for you
And it never would've gone away
You used to shine so bright
 but I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says
You look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
 and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
because I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Got away by some mistake and now
And that's the way I loved you oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
because it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
 we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
 what happened Please tell me
because one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone
 he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
 Forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
 made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
 now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
 but I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone
 he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
because it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
because I was there when you said
I'm five years old
 it's getting cold
  I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you
 I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now
 the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop until I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
I have an excellent father
 his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
 inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
 so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today
 it's a sad picture
  the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same
 another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution
 the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
 we'll sing hallelujah
So we've been outnumbered
  and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
 find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away
 say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution
 the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
 we'll sing hallelujah
 we'll stand
  get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long
 it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution
 throw your hands up
because we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah
 we sang hallelujah
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk
 you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile
 I smile
And every time you shine
 I'll shine for you
 I'm feeling you
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
 I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
because I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face
I've never been so wrapped up
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
because every time you smile
 I smile
And every time you shine
 I'll shine for you
 I'm feeling you
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
 I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
because I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you
 I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
Don't be afraid
 I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
because I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
 I'm caught up in you
 burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close
 I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable
 burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close
 I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side
 standing next to me
I'm caught up in you
But you're untouchable
 burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
 I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
  little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
because it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
 we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened Please tell me
because one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
 Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said
 Forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest

Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
 now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute

And I stare at the phone

You flashback to when he said
 Forever and always
  and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said
 Forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
 I don't think so
because it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said
 Forever and always
And I stare at the phone
 he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said
 Forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said
 Forever and always
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind
 talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
because I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
 I've got you down
  I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself
 talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear
I'll leave my window open
because I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I've watched you so long
 screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
I'll leave my window open
because I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight
 tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special
 just another wide eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name
So dim that spotlight
 tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
You played in bars
 you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see
 you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight
 tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said
 This time I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
because I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
  but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain
 coming back for more
And don't you leave because I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs
 staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
  if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left
 I wanted you to chase after me
  but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain
 coming back for more
And don't you leave because I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do
   all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain
 coming back for more
And don't you leave because I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying
 was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess
 I need you
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it
I can't put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain
 but I never do
The way the tires turn stones
 on old county roads
They leave them muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know
 you can scratch it right off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me
I lived
 and I learned
Had you
 got burned
Held out
 and held on
God knows
 too long
And wasted time
 lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your Don't you wish you had me grin
Well
 I did
  so I smiled
   and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived
 and I learned
Had you
 got burned
Held out
 and held on
God knows
 too long
And wasted time
 lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I lived
 and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see
 that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied
 and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
because no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me
Perfect face
Here to stay
Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
I've been waiting for you all my life
Every single day until the end
 I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know
Change of heart
Leaves me all alone
I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Hello Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine
Always at the right place at the right time
Hello Casually cruel
Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Perfectly fine
Never told me why
Never had to see me cry
Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
 I thought you might be different than the rest
  I guess you're all the same
because I hear he's got his arm around a brand-new girl
I've been picking up my heart
 he's been picking up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you
Hello Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine
Always at the right place at the right time
Hello Casually cruel
Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Perfectly fine
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized
 all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat
 in the best room
 he's so smug
  Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
because I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then
 you'll be Too late
Goodbye Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine
Always at the right place at the right time
Goodbye Casually cruel
Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Perfectly fine
You're perfectly fine
Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
You said you'd never go away
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back
 we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
 back when I deserved it
And we were happy
We showed them all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder because we were happy
We showed them all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy
 I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
because we were happy
 we were happy
We showed them all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
 I need some time
  need some space
To think about all of this
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when
 when it's sunny or storming
Laughing
 when I'm crying
And that's when
 I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when
 when I see your face
I'll let you in
 and baby
  that's when
When you said
 I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said
 Leave those all in our past
And you said
 When can I come back
And I said
 that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when
 when it's sunny or storming
Laughing
 when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when
 when I see your face
I'll let you in
 and baby
  that's when
And you said
That's when
 when I woke up in the morning
That's when
 it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when
 you were waiting at the front gate
That's when
 when I saw your face
You let me in
 and baby
  that's when
That's when
 when I wake up in the morning
That's when
 when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing
 when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That when I miss you
 that's when I want you
That's when
 when I see your face
That's when I love you
 that's when
 I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while
 I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothing like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy
But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you
 don't you
Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried
 but that's just something I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this
But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you
 don't you
So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say
 We're still friends
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again
Don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
 say you've missed me if you don't want me again
 know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you
 don't you
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes
 down to my skin
I'm driving away and I
 I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
because I
 I still love you but I can't
  to everything I thought was on my side
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
because you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
The picture frame is empty
On the dresser
 vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
  to everything I thought was on my side
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
because you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends
  to everything I thought was on my side
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
because you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
because you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
 you took me home
  I thought you were gonna keep me
I'm doing good
I'm on some new shit
Been saying yes
instead of
I thought I saw you at the bus stop
I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
I guess you never know
And if you wanted me
you really should've showed
And if you never bleed
you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
But we were something
don't you think so
Roaring twenties
tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense
I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know
And it's another day
waking up alone
I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today
We were something
don't you think so
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
For digging up the grave another time
Vintage tee
brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young
they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile
black lipstick
Sensual politics
But I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight
Hand under my sweatshirt
kiss it better
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls
lose the one
Giving me your weekends
Once in twenty lifetimes
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleeding
because I knew you
Stepping on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
Leaving like a father
Running like water
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
beCause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standing in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train
it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said
How did a middle class divorcee do it
The wedding was charming
if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it
Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful
if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows
if she never showed up what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dali
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits
and then it was bought by me
Who knows
if I never showed up what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time
I can see you standing
With his arms around your body
but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holding all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town
Now I'm in exile
seeing you out
I think I've seen this film before
I can see you staring
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Balancing on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now
You were my crown
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out
There is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out
You never gave a warning sign
I gave so many signs
All this time
I never learned to read your mind
I couldn't turn things around
You never turned things around
beCause you never gave a warning sign
So many signs
You didn't even see the signs
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seeing you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out
There is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out
All this time
I never learned to read your mind
Never learned to read my mind
I couldn't turn things around
You never turned things around
beCause you never gave a warning sign
You never gave a warning sign
We gather here
We line up weeping in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire
You'll be made of ashes
Even on my worst day
Did I deserve
All the hell you gave me
beCause I loved you
I swear I loved you
unTil my dying day
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around saving face
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones
Never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw
Some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to
Have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels
That I gave you
As you bury me
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
beCause when I'd fight
you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want
Just not home
And you can aim for my heart
go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the
 will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me
but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break it's in a million pieces
When no one is around
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels
Shining just for you
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels
Shining just for you
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
When no one is around
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels
Shining just for you
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels
Shining just for you
And they called off the circus
Burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses
And the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
I'm still a believer but I don't know why
I've never been a natural
All I do is try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything
To keep you looking at me
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself
Please picture me
In the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet
In the swing
Over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
but I was high
In the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart
won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with
Me and we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me
In the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream
Ferociously
Any time I wanted
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart
won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long
Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
Are you sure
Never have I ever before
But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
beCause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
beCause you were never mine
Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school
I remember thinking I had you
But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
beCause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
beCause you were never mine
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love
beCause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
beCause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
beCause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember
Remember when I pulled up
Get in the car
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
Remember when I pulled up
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
Remember when I pulled up
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels
now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve
the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
At least I'm trying
And it's hard to be at a party
When I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days
When all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel
On the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head
Keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
a million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling
mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
a million little times
And you wanna scream
Don't call me
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
Curious time
Gave me no compasses
Gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
Mystical time
Cutting me open
then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies
And it's cool
Baby with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
What did you think I'd say to that
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn
Does she smile
Or does she mouth
Fuck you forever
Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry
I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear until her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firing at your yacht
But you know I won't
And women like hunting witches
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together
Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear until her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
I'm taking my time
Taking my time
beCause you took everything from me
Watching you climb
Watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin
Has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad
Should be scathing like me
But no one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that
Keep your helmet
Keep your life
Just a flesh wound
Here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
I think he's bleeding out
And some things you just can't speak about
With you
I serve
I fall down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathing out
Something med school
Did not cover
Someone's daughter
Someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
I think she's crashing out
And some things you just can't speak about
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom
But I think it's because of me
one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me
Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you
it was just a summer thing
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you
I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds
you know that
I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times
but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you
it was just a summer thing
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long
I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
it's finally sinking in
right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
I showed up at your party
Will you have me
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it Will it patch your broken wings
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
you know I miss you
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner
beCause it lives in me
I could never give you peace
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends
It's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd
Swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild
give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough
But there's robbers to the east
Clowns to the West
I'd give you my sunshine
Give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come
If you're standing with me
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground
Stood on the cliffside
Give me a reason
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire
Stood on the cliffside
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died
so what's the movie for
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password
so I let you in the door
You knew you won
so what's the point of keeping score
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong
my beloved
neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off
but not without my muse
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I'm setting off
but not without my muse
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
beCause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
How many days did I spend thinking about how you did me wrong
Lived in the shade you were throwing until all of my sunshine was gone
And I couldn't get away from you
In my feelings more than Drake
Your name on my lips
Free rent
living in my mind
But then something happened one magical night
I forgot that you existed And I thought that it would kill me
but it didn't And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love
it isn't hate
it's just indifference
I forgot that you
Got out some popcorn As soon as my rep started going down
Laughed on the school yard As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town
Would've been right there
Even if nobody came to your show
But you showed who you are
then one magical night
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
bad boy
shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it
Killing me slow
out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice
angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new
the shape of your body
It's blue
the feeling I've got
It's a cruel summer
It's cool
that's what I tell them
No rules in breakable heaven
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying
So cut the headlights
summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
And if I bleed
you'll be the last to know
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I scream
For whatever it's worth
I love you
ain't that the worst thing you ever heard
He looks up
grinning like a devil
We could leave the Christmas lights up until January
This is our place
we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze
a mysterious way about you
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
take me out and take me home
You're my Lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now
but I want them all
Ladies and gentlemen
will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be myLover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my Lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table
I'll save you a seat
I would be complex
I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes you
What's that like
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
because if I was a man
then I'd be the man
They'd say I hustled
put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing
if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me
let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch
not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
it's okay that I'm mad
I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that
But what if I do
because cruelty
Wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches
I almost said to you
Easy they come
Easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up
It's getting so old
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright
And I cut off My nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection For years and years
I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes Die all alone
Help me hold on to you
I see right through me
beCause they see right through me
They see right through me
Can you see right through me
All the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
beCause all of my enemies Started out friends
Who could stay
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect
I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm seventeen
nobody understands
No one understands
He got my heartbeat Skipping down sixteenth Avenue
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you
bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
He better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
beCause good ones never wait
He's so obsessed with me
I understand
Lyrical smile
indigo eyes
hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks
I'll drive
I whisper in the dark
You know I adore you
I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen
lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens
marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless
ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days
I counted miles
To see you there
It's been a long time coming
It's you and me
that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway
She's a bad
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games
you win stupid prizes
there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince
We're so sad
we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
My team is losing
battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung
you are the only one Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless
the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then
where are the wise men
I'm scared
No cameras catch my muffled cries
And now the storm is coming
And I don't want you to Go
I don't really wanna Fight
beCause nobody's gonna Win
I think you should come home
I just thought you should know
And I'll never let you Go
because I know this is a Fight
That someday we're gonna Win
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
Kiss me once because you know I had a long night
Kiss me twice because it's gonna be alright
Three times because I waited my whole life
I like shiny things
but I'd marry you with paper rings
that's right
you're the one I want
I hate accidents
except when we went from friends to this
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
you're the one I want
In the winter
in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first
I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back To the color that we painted your brother's wall
without all the exes
We wouldn't be standing here so tall
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
And I hope I never lose you
I hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I get mystified by how this city screams your name
I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
Windows flung right open
autumn air
The Jacket around my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks
playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags
left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called
showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof
you and I
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago
we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk
but it's not enough
beCause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
beCause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere
the only thing we share Is this small town
You said it was a great love
one for the ages
But if the story's over
why am I still writing pages
Flashbacks waking me up
My heart
my hips
my body
my love
Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs
our films
united we stand
Our country
guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
My time
my wine
my spirit
my trust
Trying to find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much
but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright
it's just a thousand cuts
I love my hometown as much as Motown
I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen
faded blue jeans
Tennessee whiskey
But something happened
I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
like a child when our eyes meet
I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate
met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
And now I love high tea
stories from Uni
and the West End
You can find me in the pub
we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky
a rainy cab ride
don't threaten me with a good time
I love the English
I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
like a child when our eyes meet
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Stick with me
I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you
I enjoy walking SoHo
Drinking in the afternoon
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting
I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles
each night
I pray to you
Desperate people find faith
so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you
you'll get better
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses
you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon
I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it
there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to
What am I supposed to do If there's no you
This won't go back to normal
if it ever was
It's been years of hoping and I keep saying it because
beCause I have to
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you
We were stupid to jump In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like
Damn! It's Seven AM
Say it in the street
that's a knock-out
But you say it in a tweet
that's a cop out
And I'm just like
Are you okay
And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson That stressing and obsessing aBout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
You need to just stop
can you just not step on my gown
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad
When you could be GLAAD
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Just making that sign
Must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats
And then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream About all the people you hate beCause shade never made anybody less gay
can you just not step on his gown
And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now
We all got crowns
can you just not step on our gowns
I blew things out of proportion
now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back
Thought I had reason to attack
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry until it blows up
until there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much
It's on your face
and I'm to blame
I need to say
it's all me
in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do this to you
I don't wanna lose this with you
I need to say it's all me
Meet me in the afterglow
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight
I lived like an island
punished you with silence
Went off like sirens
just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much
It's on your face
don't walk away
I need to say
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful baby
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I'm the only one of me
that's the fun of me
You're the only one of you
that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
Living in winter
I am your summer
when it comes to a lover
Hey kids
Spelling is fun
Strike the band up
I promise that you'll never find another like me
School bell rings
walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves
you give me one
Wanna hang out
sounds like fun
Video games
you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
It's nice to have a friend
Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down
no curfew
twenty questions
we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand
Church bells ring
carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff
Have my back
Feels like home
stay in bed
The whole weekend
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth
but never goodbye
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air
I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I can never look away
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
Now I'm wide awake
And now I see daylight
And I can still see it all
All of you
all of me
I once believed love would be Black and white
But it's golden
And I can still see it all In my head
Back and forth from New York
Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be Burning red
Like daylight
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that I'm afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I just think that You are what you love
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone
 just you and me
Up in your room
 and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
 four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
So you were never a saint
 and I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
 mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind
 passionate as sin
  ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
 so bright
  just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray
 all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray
 all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now
 gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
 it was red
 losing him was blue like I'd never known
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
because loving him was red
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus
 eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a
 get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should
 think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you
 follow you home
I'll follow you
 follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a
 get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should
 think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you
 follow you home
Once upon a time
 a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
 you got me alone
You found me
 you found me
  you found me
I guess you didn't care
 and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
 you took a step back
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
because I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
until you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
No apologies
 he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning
 you're drowning
  you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
until you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
until you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
 your sweet disposition
And my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in the car
 getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
because there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red because you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair
 I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past
 thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
because there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs
 I was there
I remember it all too well
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared
 I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
because I remember it all
  all too well
Time won't fly
 it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
because it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
because you remember it all too well
because there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare
 I was there
  I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair
 you were there
  you remember it all
Down the stairs
 you were there
  you remember it all
It was rare
 I was there
  I remember it all too well
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
 we're happy
   confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
 it's time
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping
  confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
 it's time
I don't know about you
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
because each time you reach out
 there's no reply
I bet it never
 ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
 we made quite a mess
It's probably better off this way
And I confess
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I'd want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder about me
I remember when we broke up the first time
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
 I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
  trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I hate you
we break up
  you call me
I love you
 we called it off again last night but
 this time I'm telling you
  I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
 talk to my friends
  talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it
 screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
 you called me up again tonight but
 this time
  I'm telling you
   I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
 talk to my friends
  talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never
So he calls me up and he's like
 I still love you
And I'm like
 I'm just
  I mean this is exhausting you know
Like we are never getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
 talk to my friends
  talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
because I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said
I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears
 my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room
 all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking
 no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
And right before your eyes
I'm aching
No past
 nowhere to hide
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time
 I won't hurt you anymore
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I'm asking you
 last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
 last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
 last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
 last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
because darling
 it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
 I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
 I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
 I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
 I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Long handwritten note
 deep in your pocket
 how little they mean
  when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks
 your face in a locket
Good girls
 hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad
  tragic love affair
In dreams
 I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds
 different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling
 they all look like me
because we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad
  tragic love affair
 the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me
 try to fix it
  could you just try to listen
Hang up
 give up
  and for the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad
What we had
 a beautiful magic love there
What a sad
   love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad
  tragic love affair
New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city
 chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty
 everybody loves cool
So overnight
 you look like a sixties queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they'll tell you now
 you're the lucky one
 they'll tell you now
  you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now
 you're the lucky one
 it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky
 but you're so confused
because you don't feel pretty
 you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive
And they'll tell you now
 you're the lucky one
 they'll tell you now
  you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now
 you're the lucky one
It was a few years later
 I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity
 and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time
 but I understand it now
because now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now
 you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
 you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
 you're the lucky one
 they'll tell you now
  you're the lucky one
 they'll tell you now
  you're the lucky one
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind
 making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
 know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
 know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
 know you better now
I just wanna know you
because all I know is we said
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall
 painted blue
But I'll take them down
 take them down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind
 making up for lost time
Taking flight
 making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
 know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
 know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
 know you better now
I just wanna know you
because all I know is we said
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
 know you better now
All I know is we said
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days
 I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
  what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk
 summer of forty-five
Picks me up late one night
Out the window
 we were seventeen and crazy
  running wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said
It was the best night
 never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
 Look at you
  worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean
 saying to me
Don't you see the starlight
 starlight
Don't you dream impossible things
  what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
 never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
 he's talking crazy
 dancing with me
 we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
  what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
 never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you dream impossible things
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny because he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café
 I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
 but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
 but I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny because he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café
 I watched it begin again
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time
 what's past is past
because you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny because he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
 I watched it begin again
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that
 I'm right here
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said he'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me
 singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
You called me later
And said
 I'm sorry I didn't make it
And I said
And that was the moment I knew
You said it in a simple way
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss
 then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself
 don't get attached
But in my mind
 I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back
 be here
  come back
   be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back
 be here
  come back
   be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back
 be here
  come back
   be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back
 be here
  come back
   be here
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York
 be here
But you're in London
 and I break down
because it's not fair that you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back
 be here
  come back
   be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back
 be here
  come back
   be here
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
  I am no one's exception
 I have previously learned
So don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
 and I say
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
  I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her
So don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
 and I say
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
Call a cab
 lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab
 lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me
 you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
 everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love until it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never
Saw you coming
And I'll never
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone
 just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
 four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
I remember your bare feet
 down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
 plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me
 waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
 little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on
  with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming
Flowers pile up in the worst way
 no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day
 when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you
I remember your bare feet
 down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than loving a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again
 I just wish I could forget when it was magic
standing in the mirror
Saying to myself
 You know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
 in the middle of the night
  I can feel you again
But I just miss you
 and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
 and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy
  I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
 you never thought I'd run
 in the middle of the night
  I can feel you again
But I just miss you
 and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
 like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
 and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
 in the middle of the night
  I can feel you again
But I just miss you
 and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
 like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
 and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
 in the middle of the night
  I can feel you again
We might still be in love
 if you were a better man
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
They tell you while you're young
 go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say
 She looks like she's been through it
 what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new
How long will it be cute
 all this crying in my room
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time until I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room
People love an ingenue
I've had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new
I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
I've had too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two
And will you still want me
 will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new
What about your promises
What about your promises
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away
Big mistake
 you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call
 but I won't hear it
You said
How could you do this
What about your promises
You really blew this
We ain't getting through this one
This is the last time I'll ever call you
This is the last time
 this is the last time
This is the last time I'll ever call you
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck
 you're the wrecking ball
We said
You really blew this
We ain't getting through this one
Since you admitted it
 I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck
 I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you
 I can't love you
What a shame didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this
I'm here on the kitchen floor
 you call but I won't hear it
You said
We ain't getting through this one
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck
 you're the wrecking ball
You said
This is the last time I'll ever call you
What about your promises
I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightening
Standing here waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
  you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you
because you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless
Look how you made me
 made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
  you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you
because you could be the one that I love
And I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
How is it in London
Where were you while I'm wondering
If I'll ever see you again
You could be the one that I love
  I'm standing here hoping it gets to you
because you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love
My love
  I'm standing here hoping this gets to you
and I'm still awake
 I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me
 I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
 they let me sit in back when we were in love
 they sit around talking about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved them that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
  bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm
  it wasn't a mansion
Just living room dancing and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
 you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in
 you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams
 rolled your eyes at my jokes
Do you have all the space that you need
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me
 block it all out
The voices so loud
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're looking for
Is the love that you had
Now you're out in the world
 searching for your soul
Scared not to be hip
 scared to get old
Chasing make believe status
 last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered because you were with me
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
  I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me
 yes
I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
 my god
 she's insane
  she wrote a song about me
I bet you think about me
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says
 Why fall in love
  just so you can watch it go away
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call
 just checking up on him
He says
 It's not just a phase I'm in
My voice comes out begging
All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out
 it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
I call
 just checking up on him
Long gone
 not even listening
My voice comes out screaming
All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go
I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
All this time I didn't know
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say
 believe in one thing
  I won't go away
Give me the keys
 I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends
 they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no
There's a chain around your throat
 piece of paper where I wrote
I'll wait for you
There's a key on the chain
 there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you
And run
 like you'd run from the law
Darling
 let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is
 run
 we'll run
So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be
 no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no
And the note from the locket
 you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you
And run
 like you'd run from the law
Darling
 let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is
There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let them tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
And so it goes
Every weekend
 this same party
I never go alone and I don't seem brokenhearted
My friends all say they know everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
because they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
 then we broke each other's hearts
But don't forget about the night out in LA
Danced in the kitchen
 chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
Do you know how much I miss you
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
I miss you like it was the very first night
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
I walked through the door with you
 the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer
 even now
 your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in the car
 getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
 but I'm not fine at all
because there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red because you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair
 I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
 your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee-ball team
You taught me about your past
 thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys
 fuck the patriarchy
Key chain on the ground
 we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
 any time now
He's gonna say it's love
 you never called it what it was
until we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
because there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs
 I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret
 but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well
 maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
until you tore it all up
Running scared
 I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
because I remember it all
They say all's well that ends well
 but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me
 who was she
A never-needy
 ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened
 you
That's what happened
 you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night
 willing you to come
And he said
 It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Time won't fly
 it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
 but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
because it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
because you remember it all too well
because there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare
 I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair
 you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs
 you were there
You remember it all
It was rare
 I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at telling jokes
 but the punch line goes
I'll get older
 but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us
 did the love affair maim you
  too
because in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us
 did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us
 do you remember it all too well
Just between us
 I remember it all too well
Macavity's a mystery cat
 he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard
 the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime
 Macavity's not there
Macavity
 Macavity
  there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law
 he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime
 Macavity's not there
Macavity's a ginger cat
 he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought
 his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect
 his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side
 with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep
 he's always wide awake
Macavity
 Macavity
  there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape
 a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street
 you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered
 then Macavity's not there
He's outwardly respectable
 I know
  he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing
 Macavity's not there
Macavity
 Macavity
  there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi
 and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place
 Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie
 Rumpleteazer
  Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations
 the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity
 Macavity
  there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape
 a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street
 you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered
 then Macavity
When a crime's discovered
Macavity's not there
