I don't care about your karma
I don't care about what's hip
No space cadet's going to tell me what to do
I won't swim in your jacuzzi
You can't make me settle down
I'd rather kick and jump and bite and scratch
And scream until I'm blue
I may as well be hyper as long as I'm still around
because I'll have lots of time to be laid back
When I'm six feet underground
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
When are you cosmic cowboys
going to get it through your heads
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I can't stand the smell of incense
I don't really like to jog
No Joni Mitchell eight-tracks in my car
I hate anything organic
Even health food makes me sick
You won't catch me sipping Perrier
Down in some sushi bar
 I tell you
Now's the time to go for all the gusto you can grab
You'll have plenty of time to be low-key
When you're laid out on the slab
When are you cosmic cowboys
going to get it through your heads
I don't want no part of that vegetarian scene
I won't buy me a pair of designer jeans
No redwood hot tub to my name
I got all that I want and if it's all the same to you
I don't need a course in self-awareness
To find out who I am
And I'd rather have a
 a Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack
Than all the bean sprouts in Japan
So don't ask me what I'm into
I don't need to prove I'm cool
I'll break your arm if you ask me what's my sign
I won't tell you where my head's at
I don't need to see no shrink
Psychosis may be in this year
But I'm really not that kind
And I'm in no hurry to be casual
In fact
 I think
  I'll wait
Until I'm pushing up the daisies
Like wow
 man
  can you relate
 my little hungry one
  hungry one
Open up a package of my bologna
 I think the toast is done
  the toast is done
Top it with a little of my bologna
Never going to stop
 eat it up
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much
 then throw up
But I'll soon be back for my
Spreading on the mustard now
 show me how
Spread it on a little of this bologna
Hoping that we don't run out
 don't run out
If we do I'm sure that I'll miss bologna
Never going to stop
 eat it up
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much
 then throw up
But I'll soon be back for my
Going to the market now
 market now
I'm the city's biggest bologna buyer
Walking down the shopping isles
 shopping isles
Filling up my basket with Oscar Meyer
Never going to stop
 eat it up
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much
 then throw up
But I'll soon be back for my
How come you're always such a fussy young man
Don't want no Captain Crunch
 don't want no Raisin Bran
 don't you know that other kids are starving in Japan
So eat it
 just eat it
Don't wanna argue
 I don't wanna debate
Don't wanna hear about what kind of food you hate
You won't get no dessert until you clean off your plate
So eat it
Don't you tell me you're full
Just eat it
Get yourself an egg and beat it
Have some more chicken
 have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Your table manners are a crying shame
You're playing with your food
 this ain't some kind of game
 if you starve to death
  you'll just have yourself to blame
So eat it
 just eat it
You better listen
 better do what you're told
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole
You better chow down or it's going to get cold
So eat it
I don't care if you're full
   eat it
Open up your mouth and feed it
Have some more yogurt
 have some more spam
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned
Don't you make me repeat it
Have a banana
 have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
If it's getting cold
 reheat it
Have a big dinner
 have a light snack
If you don't like it
 you can't send it back
Get yourself an egg and beat it
oh lord
Have some more chicken
 have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Don't you make me repeat it
Have a banana
 have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
I was there to match my intellect on national TV
Against a plumber
 oh and an architect
  both with a PhD
I was tense
 I was nervous
  I guess it just wasn't my night
Art Fleming gave the answers
 but I couldn't get the questions right
I lost on Jeopardy
 baby
  ooh
I lost on Jeopardy
 I knew I was in trouble now
My hope of winning sank
 because I got the Daily Double now
And then my mind went blank
I took Potpourri for one hundred
And then my head started to spin
 I'm giving up
Just tell me now what I didn't win
I lost on Jeopardy
I lost on Jeopardy
That's right
you lost
And let me tell you what you didn't win
 a twenty set volume of the Encyclopedia International
A case of Turtle Wax
 and a years supply of Rice-A-Roni
  the San Francisco Treat
But that's not all
 you also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people
And you brought shame and disgrace to your family name for generations to come
You don't get to come back tomorrow
You don't even get a lousy copy of our home game
You're a complete loser
Don't know what I was thinking of
I guess I just wasn't to bright
 I sure hope I do better
Next weekend on the Price Is Right
I lost on Jeopardy
Fat and weak
 what a disgrace
Guess the champ got too lazy
Ain't going to fly now
 he's just taking up space
Sold his gloves
 threw his eggs down the drain
But he's no bum
 he works down the street
He bought the neighborhood deli
Back on his feet
 now he's chopping up meat
Come inside
 maybe you'll hear him say
Try the rye or the kaiser
They're on special tonight
If you want
 you can have an appetizer
You might like our salami and the liver's all right
And they'd really go well with the rye
Or the kaiser
Never eats while on the job
He heard it's good to stay hungry
But he makes a pretty mean shish-kabob
Have a taste
 they were made fresh today
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer
Stay away from the tuna
 it smells funny tonight
But you just can't go wrong with the rye
Or the kaiser
 his deli comes first
Still he dreams of his past days of glory
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst
All the while you can still hear him say
It's the rye or the kaiser
 it's the thrill of one bite
Let me please be your catering advisor
If you want substitutions I won't put up a fight
You can have your roast beef on the rye
Or the kaiser
The rye or the kaiser
I finally made it through med school
Somehow I made it through
I'm just an intern
I still make a mistake or two
I was last in my class
Barely passsed at the institute
Now I'm trying to avoid
 yah I'm trying to avoid
A malpractise suit
 like a surgeon
Cutting for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Organ transplants are my line
Better give me all your gause nurse
This patient's fading fast
Complications have set in
Don't know how long he'll last
Here we go
 time to operate
I'll pull his insides out
 pull his insides out
And see what he ate
Like a surgeon
Cutting for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Here's a waiver for you to sign
It's a fact
 I'm a quack
The disgrace of the
because my patients die
 yah my patients die
Before they can pay
Like a surgeon
Cutting for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Got your kidneys on my mind
Like a surgeon
 ooh like a surgeon
When I reach inside
With my scalpel
 and my forceps
  and retractors
I can hear your heartbeat
For the very last time
Put down that chainsaw and listen to me
It's time for us to join in the fight
It's time to let your babies grow up to be cowboys
It's time to let the bedbugs bite
You better put all your eggs in one basket
You better count your chickens before they hatch
You better sell some wine before its time
You better find yourself an itch to scratch
You better squeeze all the Charmin you can while Mr Whipple's not around
Stick your head in the microwave and get yourself a tan
Talk with your mouth full
Bite the hand that feeds you
Bite off more than you chew
What can you do
Dare to be stupid
Take some wooden nickles
Look for Mr Goodbar
Get your mojo working now
I'll show you how
You can dare to be stupid
You can turn the other cheek
You can just give up the ship
You can eat a bunch of sushi and forget to leave a tip
Dare to be stupid
Come on and dare to be stupid
It's so easy to do
Dare to be stupid
We're all waiting for you
Let's go
It's time to make a mountain out of a molehill
So can I have a volunteer
There's no more time for crying over spilled milk
Now it's time for crying in your beer
Settle down
 raise a family
  join the PTA
Buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet
And party untill you're broke and they drag you away
It's okay
 you can dare to be stupid
It's like spitting on a fish
It's like barking up a tree
It's like I said you gotta buy one if you wanna get one free
Dare to be stupid
Why don't you dare to be stupid
It's so easy to do
Dare to be stupid
We're all waiting for you
Dare to be stupid
Burn your candle at both ends
Look a gift horse in the mouth
Mashed potatoes can be your friends
You can be a coffee achiever
You can sit around the house and watch Leave It To Beaver
The future's up to you
So what you going to do
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
What did I say
Dare to be stupid
Tell me
 what did I say
Dare to be stupid
It's alright
Dare to be stupid
We can be stupid all night
Dare to be stupid
Come on
 join the crowd
Dare to be stupid
Shout it out loud
Dare to be stupid
I can't hear you
Dare to be stupid
 I can hear you now
Dare to be stupid
Let's go
 Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
I met him in a swamp down in Dagobah
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said Yoda
 I've been around
  but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet
 but he's wrinkled and green
 my Yoda
 I'm not dumb
  but I can't understand
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
 I left home just a week before
And I've never ever been a Jedi before
But Obi Wan
 he set me straight
  of course
He said
 Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force
Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
So it looks like I'm going to start all over again
With my Yoda
So I used the Force
I picked up a box
I lifted some rocks
While I stood on my head
 I won't forget what Yoda said
He said
 Luke
  stay away from the darker side
And if you start to go astray let the Force be your guide
I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed
But remember if you kill him then you'll be unemployed
 I heard my friends really got in a mess
So I'm going to have to leave Yoda I guess
But I know that I'll be coming back some day
I'll be playing this part until I'm old and gray
The long-term contract I had to sign
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time
With my Yoda
Got to work late because my alarm was busted
The boss chewed me out and everybody's disgusted
because it's one of those days
 it's just one of those days
I lost one of my socks in the drier
I can't find my wallet and my hair is on fire
Just one of those days
 it's just one of those days
I just wrapped my Cadillac around a tree
A big swarm of locusts is following me
There's not even anything good on TV
It's just one of those day
 it's just one of those days
Left all my Beatles records out in the sun
Got a Coke bottle stuck on the end of my tongue
It's just one of those days
 going to be one of those days
 tied me up and covered me with ants
And I spilled toxic waste on my brand new pants
Just one of those days
 ever have one of those days
The bank called me up and told me I'm overdrawn
Some freaks are burning crosses out on my front lawn
And I can't believe it
 all the Cheetos are gone
It's just
 just one of those
The FBI has got a tap on my phone
Those darn Russian spies won't leave me alone
Shouldn't have got up this morning
 should've known
A plane crashed into my den
And there's nothing but tater-tots for dinner again
It's just one of those days
Never mind
 it's just one of those days
Big steamroller just ran over my mom
And I cut myself shaving and they're dropping the bomb
It's just one of those days
That's all
 it's just one of those days
Then late at night
 just before I go to bed
The world blows up and now everybody's dead
You just can't deny it
 it's just like I said
 just one of those
It's just one of those days
just one of those
 one of those days
You want some lasagna magnifico
Or maybe spaghetti
 your supper's ready now
  where you go
Mama mia bambino
Mama mia bambino
You should taste my lasagna
 you no like lasagna
That's okay too
How about a calzone
Some nice minestrone
 that's good for you
Have some marinara
 I know you like
Would you like some zucchini
Or my homemade linguini
 it's hard to beat
Have more fettuccini
 you getting too skinny
  you gotta to eat
 you pass the lasagna
don't you get any on you
Have more ravioli
 nice and big
Like you cousin Luigi
 I just gotta have a tostada
That's right
 I want the whole enchilada
My only addiction has to do with a flour tortilla
I need a quesadilla
I love to stuff my face with tacos al carbón
With my friends
 or when I'm all alone
So give me something spicy and hot
Break out the menu
 what you got
 would you tell the waiter I'd like to have sour cream on the side
You better make sure the beans are refried
 there's not a taco big enough for a man like me
That's why I order two or three
Let me give you a tip
 just try a nacho chip
It's really good with bean dip
Pretty soon I can't fit in my Speedos
 I hope they feed us lots of chicken fajitas
And a pitcher of margaritas
 the combination plates all come with beans and rice
The taquitos here are very nice
Now I'm down on my knees
 we need some extra tomatoes and cheese
And could you make that separate checks
 the food is coming
  I can hardly wait
Now watch your fingers
 careful hot plate
What you think you're doing with my chile con queso
 if you want some
  just say so
They sure don't make it like this in Ohio
You can toss away the hot sauce
You better get me a bowl of guacamole
  Why's your face turning green
Don't you like pinto beans
You want some more cinnamon crispas
If you don't
Just take the rest home in a doggie bag if you wanna
You can finish it mañana
 it's been a pleasure
  I can't eat no more
If you ain't tried real Mexican cooking
Just don't drink the water
The white stuff
 The white stuff
The first one was a sweet one
Second one was a blast
Soon I finished off the bag
 ate them up real fast
You can see them in my teeth
Tell it when I talk
Had so many my pancreas just went into shock
I love the white stuff
In the middle of an Oreo
I love the white stuff
It's the most delicious thing I know
I've had a zillion or two
In my life
 they're so right
My teeth are all rotted clear through
But who cares
 What else am I supposed to do
What's in the middle
 The white stuff
The first time that I tried it
Got a big sugar buzz
Nothing gets me high as that sandwich cookie does
But I love the filling most
I rub it on my roast
Mix it in with my coffee and spread it on my toast
I love the white stuff
In the middle of an Oreo
I love the white stuff
Take some with me everywhere I go
Might get a pimple or two
  It's all right
Now Twinkies and Ding Dongs won't do
All I need
 You know what it is
What's in the middle
 The white stuff
It took a lifetime
 but I finally found
The perfect waffle recipe
You'll never find a batter any better in this whole stinking town
One little bite and I'm sure that you'll agree
Your eyes roll back and your knees get weak
 you're going to lick your plate clean
People come from miles around just to study my technique
I make the best darn waffles this world has ever seen
I'm the Waffle King
That's what they call me
 I'm the Waffle King
Everywhere I go
 the people cheer
I never have to wait in line
People say
 Right this way
Your money's no good here
Some day I betcha they'll build me a shrine
And everybody say
  I'm your biggest fan
I seen your picture in People Magazine
Folks come from around the world just to shake my hand
If you don't believe in the power of the waffle lemme show you just what I mean
That's my name
 don't wear it out
Make no mistake about it I'm the Waffle King
Roll out the red carpet
 because here I come
All you peons better scram
Out of my way
 you worthless piece of scum
Don't you know who I am
I wanna see you grovel
 you waffle eating fools
 on your knees
You wanna buy a waffle
 you're playing by my rules
Go on
 beg me
  let me hear you say pretty please
Can't you tell the universe revolves around me
Don't you know you suckers owe me everything
And can't you see that I'm the highest form of life that there could ever be
Everybody all around the world
 stand up and sing
Come on know
 what's the matter
Don't you know who I am
There's something weird in the fridge today
I don't know what it is
Food I can't recognize
My roommate won't throw a thing away
I guess it's probably his
It looks like it's alive
And living in the fridge
living in the fridge
There's something gross in the fridge today
It's green and growing hair
It's been there since July
If you can name the object
In that baggie over there
Then mister
 you're a better man than I
It's living in the fridge
You can't stop dysentery
 the mold from growing
Living in the fridge
Can't tell what
Living in the fridge
You can't stop
Living in the fridge
Tell me
 do you think it should be carbon dated
Fumigated or creamated and buried at sea
You try to save a little bit of you're home cooking
Couple weeks later
 got a scary-looking specimen
It always happens my friend
Again & again & again & again
Something stinks in the fridge today
And it's been rotting there all week
It could be liver cake or wooly mammoth steak
 maybe I should another peek
Living in the fridge
Don't know what it is
 don't know what it is
Living in the fridge
Don't know what it is
 don't know what it is
Living in the fridge
Don't know what it is at all
Living in the fridge
As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know
 I shun fancy things like electricity
in the morning I'm milking cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows
And I've been milking and plowing so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land
 I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine
Then tonight we're going to party like it's
We've been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care
 in fact I wish him well
because I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a attitude
 You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree
If you come to visit
 you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in three hundred years
But we ain't really quaint
 so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired
There's no phone
 no lights
  no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's as primitive as can be
Living in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish paradise
We don't fight
 we all play nice
Living in an Amish paradise
Hitching up the buggy
 churning lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday
 soon I'll raise another
Think you're really righteous
 Think you're pure in heart
 I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else
 my brother
  I might have to get medieval on your heinie
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no cops or traffic lights
Living in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in an Amish paradise
 long time ago In a galaxy far away
Naboo was under an attack
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
Could talk the federation in to
Maybe cutting them a little slack
But their response
 it didn't thrill us
They locked the doors and tried to kill us
We escaped from that gas
Then met Jar-Jar and Boss-Nass
We took a bongo from the scene
And we went to Theed to see the Queen
We all wound up on Tatooine
That's where we found this boy
this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later
 now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Soon I'm going to be a Jedi
Did you know this junkyard slave
Isn't even old enough to shave
But he can use the Force
 do you see him hitting on the queen
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen
 he's probably going to marry her someday
 I know he built
And I've heard how fast his pod can go
And we were broke
 it's true
So we made a wager or two
He was a prepubescent flying ace
And the minute Jabba started off that race
 I knew who would win first place
Oh yes
 it was our boy
We started singing
Now we finally got to Coruscant
The Jedi Council we knew would want
To see how good the boy could be
So we took him there and we told the tale
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale
And he might fulfill that prophecy
 the Council was impressed of course
Could he bring balance to the Force
They interviewed the kid
 training they forbid
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
And Qui-Gon said
Now listen here
Just stick it in your pointy ear
I still will teach this boy
He was singing
We caught a ride back to Naboo
because Queen Amidala wanted to
I frankly would've liked to stay
We all fought in that epic war
And it wasn't long at all before
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day
And in the end some Gungans died
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
A lot of folks were croaken
The battle droids were broken
And the Jedi I admire most
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
 I'm still here and he's a ghost
I guess I'll train this boy
this here Anakin guy
And all the
 say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi
Our temple's had a fair share of rabbis in the past
But most of them were nudniks and none of them would last
But our new guy's real kosher
 I think he'll do the trick
I tell you
 he's to die for
 he really knows his shtick
So how's by you
 Have you seen this
Reads the Torah
 does his own accounting too
Working like a dog at the synagogue
He's there all day
and he'll kick into gear
He'll bring you lots of cheer and maybe bagels with some
He shops at discount stores
 not just any will suffice
He has to find a bargain because he won't pay retail price
But if you wanna haggle
  he'll make you such a deal
People used to scoff
What's not to like
 you know he prays and prays
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise
When he's doing a Bar Mitzvah
 now that you shouldn't miss
He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss
They say he's got a lot of chutzpah
 he's really quite hip
He's doing well
Show up at his home
Have some cake
you want some cake
 he calls the shots
  we really love him lots
  Do that Hebrew thing
Who's that waddling down the street
It's just me
 because I love to eat
Fudge and Twinkies and deviled ham
Who's real flabby
 Yes I am
Every picture of me
Got to be an aerial view
Now my doctor tells me
There's just one thing left to do
Grapefruit Diet
Throw out the pizza and beer
Grapefruit Diet
 get those jelly donuts out of here
Grapefruit Diet
Might seem a little severe
Grapefruit Diet
I'm getting tired of my big fat rear
 I used to live on chocolate sauce
Made sumo wrestlers look like Kate Moss
Walked down an alley and I got stuck
I got more rolls than a pastry truck
When I'm all done eating
I eat a little more
When I leave a room
First I gotta grease the door
I gotta decrease my derriere
No more pie now
Lay off the gravy
And souffle
No french fries now
No ice cream parfait
Mr Cheese Nacho
Stay away
 I think I'd sell my soul
For a triple patty melt
But I need a boomerang
When I put on my belt
Lay off the three Musketeers
Until my big booty disappears
Grapefruit Diet
Eat them till they're coming out of my ears
because I haven't seen my feet in years
I think I'm about ready for a Quarter-Pounder with extra cheese
I need a side order of onion rings
And don't forget to Super-Size that
They see me mowing My front lawn
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy
I wanna roll with The gangsters
First in my class here at
Got skills
 I'm a Champion of
Keep your forty
I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people begging for my top eight spaces
Yo I know Pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at minesweeper I can play for days
Once you see my sweet moves you're going to stay amazed
my fingers moving so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app I haven't run
At Pascal I'm number one
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun
is my favourite theme song
I can sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
Here's the part I sing on
They see me roll on my Segway
Although it's apparent I'm too
I've been browsing
 inspecting
you know I collect them
The pens in my pocket
I must protect them
my ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized
I can recite it right now and have you
I got a business doing web sites
When my friends need some code who do they call
for them all
Even made a homepage for my dog
 Got myself a fanny pack
they were having a sale down at the
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
 Hope no one sees me getting freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
 club and Glee club and even the chess team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard
Spend every weekend at the renaissance fair
Got my name on my underwear
They see me strolling
And rolling their eyes because
I wanna bowl with
Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Don't wanna be some beer swilling hockey nut
And do I look like some frostbitten hose head
I never learned my alphabet from
They all live on donuts and moose meat
And they leave the house without packing heat
Never even bring their guns to the mall
And you know what else is too funny
Their stupid Monopoly money
Can't take them seriously at all
Well maple syrup and snow's what they export
They treat curling just like it's a real sport
They think their silly accent is so cute
Can't understand a thing they're talking
Sure they got their national health care
Cheaper meds
 low crime rates and clean air
Then again well they got Celine Dion
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni
And dream of driving a Zamboni
All over Saskatchewan
Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Won't figure out their temperature in Celsius
See the map
 they're hovering right over us
Tell you the truth
 it makes me kinda nervous
Always hear the same kind of story
Break their nose and they'll just say
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite
It's gotta mean they're all up to something
So quick
 before they see it coming
Time for a pre-emptive strike
Faces filled with joy and cheer
What a magical time of year
 It's Weasel Stomping Day
Put your Viking helmet on
Spread that mayonnaise on the lawn
Don't you know it's Weasel Stomping Day
All the little girls and boys
Love that wonderful crunching noise
You'll know what this day's about
When you stomp a weasel's guts right out
 come along and have a laugh
Snap their weaselly spines in half
Grab your boots and stomp your cares away
Hip hip hooray
 it's Weasel Stomping Day
People up and down the street
Crushing weasels beneath their feet
Why we do it
 who can say
But it's such a festive holiday
So let the stomping fun begin
Bash their weaselly skulls right in
It's tradition
 that makes it okay
Hey everyone
 it's Weasel Stomping
We'll have some fun on Weasel Stomping
Weasel Stomping Day
I'm waking up in Cheeto dust
My belly's covered with pizza crust
I'm using my inhaler now
I'm out of shape
 fattening up
I'm sipping Coke from a Solo Cup
Donut crumbs are upon my lips
 I really hate this show
I can't reach my remote control
Welcome to my new place
Sorry it's a cramped space
I'm really inactive
My muscle's gone
 atrophied
Always lose my fight with gravity
I rest my bones
 and just chillax
My NordicTrack's collecting dust
And my StairMaster's a pile of rust
This is it
 the inertia
I can't get up
 this couch is part of me
I'm growing cobwebs on my knee
Pretty sad for my age
 sad for my age
I could break my rib cage
 here is my age
I'm really inactive
  quite inactive
I'm really inactive
 not very active
Near comatose
 no exercise
Don't tag my toe
 I'm still alive
I'm giving up
 my energy is shot
I'm never moving from this spot
Never move from this place
 move from this place
I'll stay here in this place
 right in this place
I'm really inactive
 just so inactive
I'm really inactive
 not so attractive
I never seem to finish all my food
I always get a doggie bag from the waiter
So I just keep what's still unchewed
And I take it home
 save it for later
But then I deal with fungal rot
 bacterial formation
  mold and oxidation
I don't care
 I've got a secret trick up my sleeve
I never bother with baggies
 glass jars
  Tupperware containers
Plastic cling wrap
 really a no-brainer
I just like to keep all my flavours sealed in tight
With aluminum foil
Never settle for less
That kind of wrap is just the best
To keep your sandwich nice and fresh
Stick it in your cooler
Eat it when you're ready
Then maybe you'll choose
you'll choose
A refreshing herbal tea
 by the way
  I've cracked the code
I've figured out these shadow organizations
And the Illuminati know
That they're finally primed for world domination
And soon you've got black helicopters coming across the border
Puppet masters for the New World Order
there's always someone that's watching you
And still the government won't admit they faked the whole moon landing
Thought control rays
 psychotronic scanning
Don't mind that
 I'm protected because I made this hat
From aluminum foil
Wear a hat that's foil lined
In case an alien's inclined
To probe your butt or read your mind
Looks a bit peculiar
Seems a little crazy
But someday I'll prove
I'll prove
There's a big conspiracy
First things first
 I'm a craftsman
Remodelling is my only passion
it's my passion
And I'm the greatest in the business
Want referrals
will bear you witness
I can help when your door jamb sticks
There is nothing in the world I can't fix
 I'll come rushing over with my bag of tricks
Where you go when your disposal is rusted
Termite problem making you disgusted
When your front window is busted
Just one name that's always trusted
I'm so handy
 you already know
I'll fix your plumbing when your toilets over flow
I'm so handy
 I'll bring you up to code
When your dishwasher's about to explode
Now you see that your furnace is needing some service
I'm fully bonded
 no need to be nervous
Perhaps you would like a new counter Formica
Maybe I'll hook up this here combo washer dryer
But all your pipes are antique
Your water pressure's too weak
You got an attic full of dry rot cause your roof sprung a leak
Your fridge is starting to reek
Your hardwood floors really squeak
But don't you worry I'll just show you my amazing technique
Now let me glue that
 glue that and screw that
  screw that
Any random chore you got
 well I can do that
  do that
Or maybe I'll just rewire your house for fun
I got ninety nine problems but a switch ain't one
I'm so handy
 everyone said so
I'll grout your bathroom
 resurface your patio
I'm so handy
 I'm the guy to know
When your leaf blower doesn't blow
Patch the drywall
 clean your gutters and mow the lawn
Make that phone call
 I'll install anything you want
 check my big staple gun
  my socket wrenches are second to none
I won't quit until I'm done
 don't even care if I hammer my thumb
Still rocking my screwdriver
Got the whole world thinking I'm MacGyver
Your heating bills are shocking
I can solve that with some duct tape and some caulking
Your house is a disaster
Need a guy who's a master with the plaster
Let me be your stripper
Taking off lacquer
 no one does it quicker
